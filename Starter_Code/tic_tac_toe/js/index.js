//A tic-tac-toe game can have at most 9 moves. We'll maintain a variable for this and also a variable to check if the game is still going on and hasn't been won by any player yet. 

//The logic for player moves is as follows: Each player goes by pressing on an empty space on the board and also while the game is still going on. We'll use the jQuery click function for this.
